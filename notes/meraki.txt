Meraki
Meraki Cloud managed, network managment tool
	-Aim: Simplify network deployment
	-Controlled through web interface
	-IoT support for the platform
	-IoT trainset:
		-Build Lego trains
		-Add microcontrollers:
			-RaspberryPi
			-Arduino
			-ESP8266
		-Add APIs to microcontrollers
		-Allows data harvesting at scale
	-Steal data from enterprise clients
	-API interface provided API first design
	-JAM stack-ish
	-Cameras:
		-Parts:
			-Camera
			-Closed circuit storage
		-Meraki Cameras:
			-Smartphone capability
			-Stores footage on device itself
			-When you want to view footage SSL tunnel to camera
			-CV to make recording smart:
				-Tag footage based off object detection
					-Car detection
					-How many people in lobby according to camera 3
					-Analytics
			-MQTT Protocol
				-Publish Subscribe system alla Twitter
				-Follow certain topics
				-Add tags to your own broadcasts
				-Allows real time telemetry from cameras
			-Use streaming capabilites to talk to devices:
				-Turn light on when person starts walking upstairs
				-Intruder detection/warning
			-Hit API to feed into other services ie AWS Recoknition
		-Special lens to allow motor esc experience without need for error prone motors
	-API provides all data from Meraki dasboard in RESTful way <3
	-Location API:
		-Wireless + BT radios
		-Phone Tracking:
			-Track broadcast requests to track location of users
			-EVIL
			-Data now anomynised with fake details therefore only connected clients are tracked
			-T&Cs make users "aware" of tracking
		-Beacon tracking:
			-Microcontroller sends requests to APs
			-Can then be tracked
		-Non tracked location aware data:
			-AP beacons
			-Client can then execute events based of the new location information example:
				-Museum showing exhibit info
	-Captive Portal API
		-Custom splash pages for accessing APs
		-Client -> AP -> WebServer -> AP
	-Webhook API
		-Push message (similar to REST)
		-Event driven notifications
	-MV Sense
		-Camera -> MQTT Broker -> Client
		-Zone areas of camera to allow specific analytics
	-Custom dashboard
		-Allows integration with 3rd party APIs
		-example
			-MV Sense -> AWS -> Dashboard
	-Casestudy Mapwize
		-Indoor mapping + location services
		-Uses Meraki APIs
	-Meraki DevNet
		-OSS demos for different APIs (explore tab)
		-NodeRed dashboard for Meraki APIs



Flow based programming
	-Connect componenets
	-Allows greater focus on the business solution
	-Zapier:
		-Connect business applications
		-Gmail -> dropbox -> ???
	-NodeRed:
		-Open Source flow based programming tool
		-Created by IBM
		-Written with NodeJS backend + Drag and drop + JS frontend
		-Run on Docker
